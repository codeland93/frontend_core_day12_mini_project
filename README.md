# PokeAPI Integration Project

Welcome to the PokeAPI Integration Project! This project is a web application that allows users to explore Pokémon data, build their own Pokémon team, and even simulate battles between their team and an opponent's team. It's built using HTML, CSS (with a John Wick theme and 90s retro design), Bootstrap, and Asynchronous JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an engaging and interactive experience for Pokémon enthusiasts. Users can search for specific Pokémon, view their stats, build a team of their favorite Pokémon, and simulate battles. The project uses the PokeAPI to fetch real-time Pokémon data and integrates it with a custom-designed frontend.

## Features

- **Search for Pokémon**: Search by name or ID and view detailed information, including type, stats, abilities, and more.
- **Build a Team**: Add up to 6 Pokémon to your team from the search results. Your team is stored locally, so you can revisit and continue building.
- **Simulate Battles**: Compare your team's stats against a randomly generated opponent team to see who wins!
- **Responsive Design**: The project is styled using Bootstrap and a custom CSS theme inspired by John Wick and 90s retro aesthetics.
